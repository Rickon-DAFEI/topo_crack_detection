# Topo crack detection
This repository contains the codes for crack detection using topological loss function. The methodology hereby implemented was presented in the paper ["TOPO-Loss for continuity-preserving crack detection using deep learning" by Pantoja-Rosero et., al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.128264)
